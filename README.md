Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create,
process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data.
Typically, IT is used in the context of enterprise operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. 
 The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telephony.
The term information technology was coined by the Harvard Business Review, in order to make a distinction between purpose-built 
machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability advanced while device cost and energy consumption fell lower, 
a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.
